## **Hello, you've reached Nadia's automated personal stylist.**

This code uses Tracery created by [Kate Compton](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) with the Python port provided by [Allison Parrish](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery).


### _How do I use this?_

This code comes in 2 parts; The tracery outfit generator and the style classifier. 
The wardrobe.csv file is my personal wardrobe transcribed into excel but can easily be edited for anyone else to use with items from their own closet. The fashiondata.csv is a dataset of clothing descriptions and attributes. This has been curated manually and labelled. The code matches outfits together from the garments in the wardrobe.csv file and then classifies the style of the output. Run the 'Automated Stylist' jupyter notebook to test it out.

### _What's the point?_

Fashion has a huge sustainability issue. Several companies who have tried to address this have even been accused for greenwashing in a bid to actually sell even more clothes. The conversation has been too focussed on recycling and too little on the first two R's, 'Reduce' and 'Reuse'. Instead of continuing to buy more, it might be better to remind ourselves of what we already own and to play around with mixing and matching instead of adding.
